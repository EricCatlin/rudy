# Commit messages

We rely on commits in the master branch to follow the
[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#specification)
specification. These are used for changelog and version number generation.

If commits in a feature branch don't follow the convention, then its also
possible to generate a squashed merge commit when merging a pull request that
does follow it.
